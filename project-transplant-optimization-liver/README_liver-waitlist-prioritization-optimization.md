# Liver Waitlist Prioritization Optimization Proposal

>_Prepared by: Ayana Andrews-Joseph, MDA, MPH_

## 📌 Project Title
**Optimization Proposal for Liver Waitlist Prioritization: A Data-Driven Approach to Reduce Mortality and Improve Match Efficiency**

## 🧠 Overview
This project proposes a data- and modeling-based framework to optimize **liver waitlist (LWL) prioritization** at a transplant center. The aim is to improve outcomes for patients and the organization by leveraging optimization techniques to supplement the current first-come, first-served and MELD-based process.

> **Objective:** Enhance liver transplant prioritization using operational research models that balance clinical urgency, patient readiness, and logistical constraints.

## 🎯 Goals
- Decrease mortality rates among waitlisted patients
- Improve transplant success outcomes
- Ensure equitable allocation of donor organs
- Reduce geographic and readiness-based disparities

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Optimization Modeling**: Mathematical programming via solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi)
- **Data Engineering**: Data collection, wrangling, and prep across legacy and new EHR systems
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporating MELD score, patient readiness (insurance, psych evals, etc.), geographic constraints (cold ischemia time)
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involving clinicians, analysts, and academic partners

## 📊 Key Features of the Model
- Prioritization by urgency (90-day mortality risk)
- Integration of transplant readiness metrics
- Use of marginal livers based on competitive match environment
- Geographic feasibility and time-to-transplant logistics

## 🔁 Collaboration Framework
- Internal: Clinicians, transplant program leaders, data science & IT
- External: University graduate students fulfilling real-world internship hours

## ⏱️ Timeline (9–12 months)
| Phase                         | Duration         |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| Data Collection & Wrangling | 3–6 months       |
| Model Development           | 1 month          |
| Evaluation & Finalization   | 2–4 months       |

> Note: Data readiness may vary due to recent EHR system changes.

## 📐 Outcome Metrics
- Reduced waitlist mortality rates (SRTR benchmarks)
- Improved match rates
- Decreased marginal liver discard

## 📝 Resume Bullets
- Designed a multi-variable optimization model to prioritize liver transplant waitlist patients using clinical severity, readiness, and logistic constraints, inspired by OPTN allocation reforms.
- Led a research proposal integrating MELD score predictions with socio-clinical features, aiming to reduce waitlist mortality by improving match efficiency and minimizing geographic disparities.

## 📎 Reference
- Based on national strategies by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)
- Measured against KPIs from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR)
