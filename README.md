# 👩🏽‍💻 A@Work

Welcome to my professional playground — a curated portfolio of data-driven projects that reflect my skills in analytics, platform strategy, and behavioral modeling.

This repo is a living archive of real-world insights, elegant technical execution, and the kind of grit that only comes from showing up, solving hard problems, and making it make sense.

I am a data analyst with a heart for systems, a brain for behavioral intelligence, and a voice for those still underrepresented in tech spaces. This repo is part of my commitment to **excellence, ownership, and impact.**
