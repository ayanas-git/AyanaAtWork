# 👩🏽‍💻 AyanaAtWork

Welcome to my professional playground — a curated portfolio of data-driven projects that reflect my skills in analytics, platform strategy, and behavioral modeling.

This repo is a living archive of real-world insights, elegant technical execution, and the kind of grit that only comes from showing up, solving hard problems, and making it make sense.
