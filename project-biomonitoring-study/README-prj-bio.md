# Virginia Biomonitoring Program: </br> Baseline Exposure Assessment to Toxic Metals

## Overview

This project documents a biomonitoring study designed to evaluate baseline exposure to six toxic metals and perchlorate across a geographically-representative population in Virginia. Conducted through a collaboration between the **Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services (DCLS)** and the **Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)**, the study recruited participants from the **Virginia Community College System (VCCS)** to ensure regional diversity while maintaining a cost-effective and scalable design.

## Key Objectives

- Assess baseline environmental exposures to **barium, beryllium, cadmium, lead, thallium, uranium**, and **perchlorate** in Virginia residents.
- Utilize a **convenience cohort** recruited from VCCS campuses to reflect regional geographic distribution.
- Provide **region-specific exposure data** to inform environmental health policies and public health interventions.

---

## Methodology

- **Recruitment Sites:** 23 VCCS campuses spanning urban, rural, and coastal areas.
- **Participants:** Students, faculty, and staff; self-collected urine samples.
- **Design Consideration:** Prioritized geographic coverage over perfect demographic representation.
- **Data Comparison:** Study results compared to **CDC NHANES** benchmarks.
