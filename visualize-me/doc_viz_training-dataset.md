# ðŸ“Š Visual Assessment of the Training Dataset

### ðŸ§  Why This Matters

Before diving into modeling, itâ€™s critical to visualize not just the **full dataset**, but also your **training and test splits**. The visualization above breaks it down into three views:

- **Full Data**: The raw historical average price across multiple years  
- **Split Data**: A closer look at how slicing changes representation  
- **Final Train Set (80/20)**: The training data used for modeling

Each subset carries forward â€” or potentially **loses** â€” key patterns from the original data.

> **Takeaway**: Assessing your data splits visually ensures your training set is representative, not skewed. This helps avoid bias, overfitting, and inaccurate generalization.

âœ… **Visual check = sanity check.**
